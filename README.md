# Overview

This project investigates how **county-level social vulnerability indicators relate to disaster assistance outcomes** and whether incorporating spatial relationships between counties improves predictive modeling. Rather than reproducing the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) itself, the study evaluates how the underlying socioeconomic indicators captured by SVI explain variation in disaster recovery assistance across counties.

The analysis begins with **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to examine the statistical distributions, feature relationships, and geographic patterns of the SVI indicators. A **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** is then implemented as a deep learning baseline to model nonlinear relationships between vulnerability indicators and disaster assistance outcomes using tabular data alone.

To incorporate geographic context, counties are represented as nodes in a spatial graph based on adjacency relationships, allowing neighboring counties to influence each other during model training. A **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** is subsequently applied to evaluate whether spatial neighborhood aggregation improves predictive performance.

Finally, the project compares **tabular deep learning and graph-based models within a unified regression framework** to assess the role of spatial connectivity in disaster vulnerability modeling and determine whether geographic structure provides predictive signal beyond the socioeconomic indicators themselves.

# Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between county-level social vulnerability indicators and the distribution of disaster assistance using machine learning and spatial modeling techniques. Using the 2018 CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) indicators as predictors and FEMA Individual Household Program (IHP) assistance from 2018-2020 as the target outcome, the project evaluates whether incorporating spatial structure improves predictive performance. A nonlinear multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline and a graph convolutional network (GCN) are implemented within a unified regression framework to compare tabular and spatial learning approaches.

The analysis uses log-transformed socioeconomic indicators, standardized features, and fixed train/validation/test splits to ensure consistent evaluation. Hyperparameters for both models are selected through controlled ablation experiments, and the best-performing configurations are retrained before final evaluation on a held-out test set.

Results show that the **MLP baseline outperforms the spatial GCN model across evaluation metrics**. The best MLP configuration achieves a test RMSE of 2.0048 and an $R^2$ of 0.5712, while the GCN achieves a test RMSE of approximately 2.4050 and an $R^2$ of 0.3829. Overall, the results suggest that while social vulnerability indicators provide meaningful signals for predicting disaster assistance outcomes, additional **spatial modeling does not necessarily yield improvements** when the underlying spatial dependency in the target variable is limited.

The study provides a reproducible modeling framework for integrating vulnerability indicators, disaster assistance data, and graph-based learning methods, while highlighting the importance of strong tabular baselines when evaluating spatial machine learning approaches.


# Project Contributions

This project contributes both practical insights into disaster vulnerability analysis and technical advancements in modeling spatial socioeconomic data:

1) **Empirical evaluation of vulnerability indicators and disaster assistance outcomes.**
  The study quantifies the extent to which county-level social vulnerability indicators correspond to the distribution of FEMA Individual Household Program assistance from 2018-2020, providing evidence that socioeconomic vulnerability explains a substantial portion of variation in disaster aid outcomes.

2) **Evidence-based comparison of spatial and non-spatial predictive models.**
  The results demonstrate that a well-tuned tabular neural network can outperform a spatial graph neural network for this task, offering practical guidance for analysts deciding whether spatial modeling is necessary for similar socioeconomic datasets.

3) **Reproducible analytical pipeline for vulnerability modeling.**
  The project establishes a transparent workflow for integrating CDC SVI indicators, county adjacency graphs, and disaster assistance outcomes into a consistent machine learning evaluation framework.

Together, these contributions provide a methodologically rigorous and practically relevant framework for studying how social vulnerability indicators relate to disaster outcomes, while also illustrating the strengths and limitations of spatial deep learning approaches for structured socioeconomic datasets.

# Methodology

The analysis follows a structured pipeline:

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (01_eda.ipynb)

Several analyses were conducted to understand the statistical and geographic structure of the dataset prior to model development:

- **Feature Distribution Analysis**  
  Examine the distributions of the SVI percentage indicators using histograms and summary statistics.

- **Log Feature Transformation**  
  Apply log transformations to reduce skewness and stabilize variance for modeling.

- **Correlation Analysis**  
  Compute Pearson correlation matrices to assess relationships among vulnerability indicators and identify potential multicollinearity.

- **Unsupervised Clustering & Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Analyze the variance structure of the indicators using PCA to evaluate whether a smaller set of latent components explains most of the variability in the dataset. Clustering techniques are also applied to explore whether counties naturally group into distinct vulnerability profiles based on their socioeconomic characteristics.

## 2. Baseline Deep Learning Model (02_mlp.ipynb)

A **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** was implemented as a baseline model for predicting county-level disaster assistance outcomes using tabular SVI indicators.

Reasons for selecting an MLP baseline:

- Captures nonlinear relationships between socioeconomic indicators and outcomes  
- Well-suited for tabular regression tasks  
- Provides a deep learning benchmark before introducing spatial structure

The model consists of a fully connected feedforward architecture with ReLU activations, trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

## 3. Spatial Graph Modeling (03_gcn.ipynb)

To incorporate geographic structure, counties are represented as nodes in a spatial graph constructed using **Queen contiguity adjacency**, where neighboring counties share an edge.

A **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** is applied to learn county representations by aggregating information from neighboring counties. This enables the model to capture localized spatial dependencies in vulnerability indicators that may influence disaster assistance outcomes.


# Data Summary

The county-level 2018 Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) dataset is a relative vulnerability dataset designed to identify counties that may be more vulnerable before, during, and after hazardous events. The dataset integrates socioeconomic indicators derived primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey and converts them into percentile-based vulnerability rankings across U.S. counties. SVI variables are organized through a structured pipeline of derived fields. These include raw estimate fields (`E_`), margin-of-error fields (`M_`), derived percentage fields (`EP_`), percentage margin-of-error fields (`MP_`), percentile-ranked indicator fields (`EPL_`), theme sums (`SPL_`), theme percentile rankings (`RPL_THEME1` through `RPL_THEME4`), and the overall percentile ranking (`RPL_THEMES`). Higher percentile values correspond to greater relative social vulnerability compared with other counties.

In this study, the SVI dataset is used as a feature dataset representing underlying social and demographic conditions at the county level.

## Core SVI Feature Set: 15 Social Vulnerability Variables

The primary predictive feature set consists of 15 socioeconomic indicators, organized into four themes within the official SVI framework. These indicators are expressed as percentages (`EP_*` variables) derived from underlying American Community Survey estimates.

**Theme 1: Socioeconomic Status**
This theme captures economic hardship and limited access to financial resources.

* **`E_POV` / `EP_POV`:** persons below poverty level
* **`E_UNEMP` / `EP_UNEMP`:** civilian unemployed population age 16+
* **`E_PCI` / `EP_PCI`:** per capita income
* **`E_NOHSDP` / `EP_NOHSDP`:** persons age 25+ with no high school diploma

**Theme 2: Household Characteristics**
This theme captures age-related dependency, disability, and family structure vulnerabilities.

* **`E_AGE65` / `EP_AGE65`:** persons aged 65 and older
* **`E_AGE17` / `EP_AGE17`:** persons aged 17 and younger
* **`E_DISABL` / `EP_DISABL`:** civilian noninstitutionalized population with a disability
* **`E_SNGPNT` / `EP_SNGPNT`:** single-parent households with children under 18

**Theme 3: Minority Status and Language**
This theme captures minority population representation and language barriers.

* **`E_MINRTY` / `EP_MINRTY`:** minority population percentage, defined as persons who are Hispanic or Latino of any race or non-Hispanic persons belonging to racial minority groups
* **`E_LIMENG` / `EP_LIMENG`:** persons age 5+ who speak English “less than well”

**Theme 4: Housing Type and Transportation**
This theme captures housing structure, crowding, and transportation access.

* **`E_MUNIT` / `EP_MUNIT`:** housing in structures with 10 or more units
* **`E_MOBILE` / `EP_MOBILE`:** mobile homes
* **`E_CROWD` / `EP_CROWD`:** occupied housing units with more people than rooms
* **`E_NOVEH` / `EP_NOVEH`:** households with no vehicle available
* **`E_GROUPQ` / `EP_GROUPQ`:** persons living in group quarters

## FEMA Disaster Assistance Data Summary

Disaster assistance outcomes used in this study are obtained directly from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) OpenFEMA API, specifically the Individuals and Households Program (IHP) Valid Registrations dataset. This dataset records household-level disaster assistance provided to individuals following federally declared disasters and includes information on financial assistance amounts, geographic location, and disaster identifiers. 

The dataset is accessed programmatically using the OpenFEMA API endpoint. The following fields are retrieved directly from the OpenFEMA API:

* **`disasterNumber`:** FEMA disaster identifier
* **`incidentBeginDate`:** date when the disaster incident began
* **`fips`:** county-level FIPS geographic identifier
* **`ihpAmount`:** total FEMA Individuals and Households Program assistance awarded for a registration

Because the FEMA dataset records assistance at the individual registration level, the data are aggregated to the county level using the FIPS geographic identifier. The final modeling target is constructed by summing all `ihpAmount` values within each county across the 2018–2020 period. This produces a county-level measure of total disaster assistance received during 2018-2022, which serves as the regression target for the study's ML models. The FEMA dataset also includes county-level FIPS codes, allowing the aggregated assistance outcomes to be merged directly with the SVI dataset and county geometries. This shared geographic identifier enables the integration of socioeconomic vulnerability indicators, disaster assistance outcomes, and spatial adjacency relationships within a unified county-level dataset used for modeling.
